			<title>How to typeset a date range properly</title>
			<link>http://clagnut.com/blog/2419/</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As I write this we in the <abbr class='c2sc'>UK</abbr> are reaching the culmination of 10 days of mourning following the death of the Queen. Wherever you look – on websites, billboards and shop windows – we are reminded of the longevity of Her Majesty’s life. More precisely we’re presented with a date range: 1926 – 2022.</p>

</div><!-- /.prose --><figure><img src="http://clagnut.com/images/2419/queen.jpg" alt="Photo of the Queen on a bus stop advertising screen" /><figcaption>Messages about the Queen on screens in bus stops and shop windows throughout the city</figcaption></figure><div class='prose'>

<p>A badly typeset date range, usually comprising a hyphen surrounded by two spaces. “What’s wrong with that?,” you might well ask. A lack of attention to detail for a start. There is a long-standing convention for how to properly typeset a date range, or any numerical range for that matter, but it involves going a bit deeper beyond what faces on our standard keyboards (which are still relics from the age typewriters).</p>

<p>Even the <a href="https://www.royal.uk">Royals’ own website</a> makes the same mistake:</p>

</div><!-- /.prose --><figure><img src="http://clagnut.com/images/2419/hyphen.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /><figcaption>Royal.uk uses a spaced hyphen for the date range, made worse by letter-spacing<figcaption></figure><div class='prose'>

<p>The preferred way is to use an <em>en-dash</em> instead of a hyphen, and separate it from the numerals with a <em>thin-space</em>, like this:</p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.5em">1926 – 2022</span></p>

<p>Compare with the poorly typeset:</p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.5em">1926&#32;&#45;&#32;2022</span></p>

<p>The point here is that the date range is a self-contained element, an individual thought if you like, not two loosely connected items. Using a tightly spaced dash joins the numerals together into a single element.</p>

<p>Any typographically configured <abbr class='c2sc'>CMS</abbr> should automatically convert your number-space-hyphen-space-number combination for you, swapping in thin spaces and en-dash. If you need to manually insert the desired characters, the easiest way for you right now is to cut and paste straight out of this page – they are standard Unicode glyphs.</p>

<p>I also use a handy Unicode character finder for these purposes. There’s a few around, but my favourite is <a href="https://glyphfinder.com">Glyphfinder</a> for MacOS. (The Glyphfinder website was down for me at the time of writing, but you can get the <a href="https://ueberdosis.gumroad.com/l/ZaEQz">download from Gumroad</a> for the price of a pint).</p>

			<title>How to subset a variable font</title>
			<link>http://clagnut.com/blog/2418/</link>
			<guid>http://clagnut.com/blog/2418/</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Using variable fonts can be an excellent way to reduce bandwidth and latency as they can highly efficiently combine multiple styles into one font file. However, as with standard professional fonts, they can contain a lot characters you will never use (in my case this would include Greek and Cyrillic – your mileage will vary). These un-needed characters can be removed from the font to reduce file-size, a process called subsetting.</p>

<p>This post is primarily an aide-memoire explaining how to subset fonts from first principles on a Mac (macOS Monterey 12.3.1 at time of writing). I&#8217;ll be using <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools">fonttools</a>, an open source font manipulation library written in Python, to subset a font and create a <abbr class='c2sc'>WOFF2</abbr> font file for use on the Web.</p>

<h3>1.&nbsp;Install&nbsp;Python</h3>

<p>macOS no longer comes bundled with Python, so firstly download and install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/">the latest version of Python 3</a> following the instructions in the macOS installer.</p>

<h3>2.&nbsp;Install&nbsp;fonttools</h3>

<p>Once Python 3 has installed successfully, open Terminal and install fonttools using pip (which is shipped with Python):</p>

<figure class="pre" data-element="code-block"><div class="code-block__header"><div role="alert"></div></div><pre><code class="language-css">python3 -m pip install fonttools
</code></pre></figure>

<h3>3.&nbsp;Install&nbsp;Brotli</h3>

<p>Next install Brotli compression, which is required to output a <abbr class='c2sc'>WOFF2</abbr>.</p>

<figure class="pre" data-element="code-block"><div class="code-block__header"><div role="alert"></div></div><pre><code class="language-css">python3 -m pip install brotli
</code></pre></figure>

<h3>4. Move to where the font&nbsp;file&nbsp;is</h3>

<p>Change the Terminal directory to the folder containing the font file you want to convert, eg.</p>

<figure class="pre" data-element="code-block"><div class="code-block__header"><div role="alert"></div></div><pre><code class="language-css">cd /Users/rich/
</code></pre></figure>

<h3>5.&nbsp;Run&nbsp;fonttools</h3>

<p>Finally run the fonttools subsetting routine using the desired options. For example:</p>

<figure class="pre" data-element="code-block"><div class="code-block__header"><div role="alert"></div></div><pre><code class="language-css">pyftsubset LiterataTT.ttf 
    -unicodes="U+0020-007F, U+00A0-00FF, U+0100-017F, U+2000-206F, U+2070-209F, U+20A0-20CF, U+2100-214F, U+2200-22FF, U+FB00-FB4F" 
    -layout-features='*' 
    -flavor="woff2" 
    -output-file="LiterataTT.woff2"
</code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case I am subsetting <a href="https://www.type-together.com/literata-font"><code>LiterataTT.ttf</code></a> and outputting as <code>LiterataTT.woff2</code> into the same directory.</p>

<p>The <code>unicodes</code> option specifies which characters to include in the subset, by way of <a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/">Unicode character ranges</a>. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the font doesn&#8217;t have all the Unicode ranges available in the list, or all the characters within a specified range – these just get ignored. In this case I am including the following Unicode ranges:</p>

</div><!-- /.prose --><figure class="fig-table">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr><td>U+0020-007F</td><td><a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/0020-007F">Basic Latin</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+00A0-00FF</td><td><a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/00A0-00FF">Latin-1 Supplement</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+0100-017F</td><td><a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/0100-017F">Latin Extended-A</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+2000-206F</td><td><a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/2000-206F">General Punctuation</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+2070-209F</td><td><a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/2070-209F">Superscripts and Subscripts</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+20A0-20CF</td><td><a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/20A0-20CF">Currency Symbols</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+2100-214F</td><td><a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/2100-214F">Letterlike Symbols</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+2200-22FF</td><td><a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/2200-22FF">Mathematical Operators</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+FB00-FB4F</td><td><a href="https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/FB00-FB4F">Alphabetic Presentation Forms</a></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure><div class='prose'>

<p>The <code>layout-features</code> option specifies which OpenType layout features to include, such as kerning, ligatures, numerals and alternate characters. In this example I&#8217;m using <code>layout-features='*'</code> to include all the features available. Instead, you can also add selected features to the default set. For example <code>layout-features+=onum,pnum,ss01</code> will keep the default set of features and add <code>onum</code>, <code>pnum</code> and <code>ss01</code> (old-style and proportional numerals, and styleset 1). The default features include <code>calt</code>, <code>clig</code>, <code>kern</code> and <code>liga</code> among others. See the <a href="https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subset/index.html?highlight=layout-features#glyph-set-expansion">fonttools Documentation</a> for more info on <code>layout-features</code>.</p>

<p>Applying that subsetting routine to LiterataTT reduced the original font file from 913Kb to 207Kb. The latter is still a fairly large file, but I was conservative in my subsetting (as in keeping in plenty of European characters and OpenType features) and, as a variable font, this file will cover all situations from light to black weights and low to high contrast optical sizing.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just about squeezed this out while it&#8217;s still January – my annual compilation of favourite songs from those I bought in the last year (not all were released this year). As a deviation from the electronic pop favourites of last year, I&#8217;ve gone a bit post-punk, or whatever the kids are calling it nowadays: Squid; Black Country, New Road; and a cracking new album from Mogwai. But my absolute favourite is Darkside (both albums) and Nicolas Jaar from 2013.</p>

<p>RÃ³isÃ­n Murphy gets in again, with a banging remix from her producer Crooked Man. Snapped Ankles make a welcome return and there&#8217;s a fab Hot Chip remix of long time favourite Django Django.</p>

</div><!-- /.prose --><figure><img src="http://clagnut.com/images/2021vinyl.jpg" alt="Photo" /><figcaption>Over fifty vinyl records spread out on my floor</figcaption></figure><div class='prose'>

<p>Because I keep these playlists roughly to the length of a <abbr class='c2sc'>CD</abbr>, there are some notable omissions from this list. Black Midi is one, although I find it a little hard work at the moment. Also a classic oldie from Metronomy, some Seventies jazz funk from Ian Carr&#8217;s Nucleus, and a classic album from Love which was largely unknown to me – an omission generously corrected by my good friend Anthony.</p>

			<title>One year on and what next for remote working?</title>
			<link>http://clagnut.com/blog/2415/</link>
			<guid>http://clagnut.com/blog/2415/</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>A year ago this week the <abbr class='c2sc'>UK</abbr> went into its first lockdown. Like most savvy businesses, Clearleft had already closed our studio and started working from home. Also like many businesses, we&#8217;ve yet to reopen our office, but more on that later.</p>

<p>I remember clearly the faces on peopleâ€™s faces when I announced we&#8217;d be working remotely until the end of April. There was a combination of surprise, disbelief, resignation and even horror (perhaps due to the looming spectre of home-schooling). Just as everyoneâ€™s experience has been different over the past year, so everyone&#8217;s initial reaction was different too.</p>

<p>We didnâ€™t have to make a huge cultural shift in order to work remotely. Weâ€™re a small enough company that we all know each other and whatâ€™s expected of us. Weâ€™d built up enough trust, and working from home was already allowed without question. That said, working from home was an occasional thing: to let in a plumber, deal with some childcare, and frequently – presciently perhaps – to get stuff done. And it was <em>working from home</em> – it wasn&#8217;t <em>remote working</em>, which as weâ€™ve all come to realise is a different beast entirely.</p>

<p>We managed to adapt to the situation fairly quickly. A culture of autonomy and generally mucking-in helped, as did an assurance that everyoneâ€™s job would be safe for the coming months even if it meant us losing money in the short term (we didnâ€™t). All this meant we could get on with the job of supporting our clients, who were certainly nowhere near close to working remotely when lockdown happened, and needed all the help they could get.</p>

<p>We knew we were doing something right in terms of remote working when one of our staff, who had been on sabbatical in South America when the pandemic struck, managed to make it back to Europe. While everyone else worked from home in or around Brighton, Tom found himself working from Spain initially, and then from London. And no-one really noticed, apart from a surprising change in decor. And thatâ€™s point – you can remote work from anywhere provided you can negotiate timezones.</p>

<p>The <abbr class='c2sc'>UK</abbr> is now in its third lockdown, but with a successful rollout of the vaccine, a way out and a change is approaching. Once lockdown is lifted, hopefully in a few months, will we become fully remote? I doubt it. Remote-first, whatever that means? Perhaps. We&#8217;ve certainly loosened our <a href="https://clearleft.com/about/jobs">hiring</a> policy – we no longer require people to permanently work from our Brighton studio. This enabled us to hire <a href="https://clearleft.com/about/team/christianne-beck">Christianne</a>, our fantastic new head of events, who is currently based in London. That said Brighton is within commuting distance of London, so itâ€™s certainly near enough to pop down every now and then, which will probably be beneficial.</p>

<p>For now our beloved <a href="https://68middle.st">68 Middle Street</a> stays closed, but weâ€™ll be partially reopening in June as a broadcast studio for <a href="https://uxlondon.com">UX Fest</a> and as an early test of Covid precautions and an assessment of everyoneâ€™s appetite for being in relatively close human proximity. Come July, by which time hopefully all Covid restrictions will be lifted, weâ€™ll open more fully.</p>

<p>But how will we be working come July? We don&#8217;t exactly know, but that&#8217;s fine because we can try things and quickly adapt to changing needs. After all, we managed to go from studio-based to fully remote in matter of days.</p>

<p>A few things seem certain. We&#8217;ve regularly talked and periodically surveyed staff about how they are coping with remote work, and their attitude to returning to the office. People&#8217;s circumstances and feelings all differ. These are difficult times – at some point weâ€™ve all felt sad, lonely, claustrophobic or tired. But thereâ€™s also been plenty of rays of light, with working from home being liberating, productive and flexible. What we do share is a common inclination to be in the same space as other people, at least for some of the time.</p>

<p>That may be a general reaction to being cooped up during so many weeks of lockdown after lockdown, but there&#8217;s a keen desire to talk and work face to face, if not permanently. Weâ€™ve all had the time and some budget to get set up for remote working, and weâ€™ve come to appreciate the benefits it can bring. We definitely don&#8217;t want to lose those. But we&#8217;re all human, which means we&#8217;re sociable creatures at heart. Furthermore Clearlefties are – by design – a nice bunch of people. We&#8217;re the kind of people we want to spend time with, so itâ€™s only natural weâ€™d want to come into the office together.</p>

<p>All of which points us towards a hybrid way of working. Part remote, part in the studio, with all of us in one or other mode part of time, but probably at different times and differing amounts. The key to getting this to work will be to ensure that neither mode of working advantages one person over another. We&#8217;ll need to ensure that while working remotely, someone isnâ€™t excluded from decisions or collaboration, and minimise the fear of missing out on informal conversations. We&#8217;ll need to improve our setup to better enable remote people to participate in meetings where multiple attendees happen to be in the studio. Likewise we need to ensure that if you&#8217;re in the studio you can participate fully in remote discussions and activities – right now we have a large open plan studio that can get pretty noisy. And we&#8217;ll need to track and assess this so we can keep making improvements in working practice and environment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our clients will be asking themselves similar questions. Perhaps some will go back fully into the office; some may go fully remote. But one great thing that has happened is they – and we – now have 12 months hard-earned experience of working remotely. As designers and consultants we wonâ€™t have to travel as much as we used to in order to research and collaborate, which is great for many reasons including productivity, work-life balance and the environment.</p>

<p>In light of the ongoing tragedy that is the coronavirus pandemic, it would be trite to trot out an aphorism such as &#8216;never let good crisis go to waste&#8217;. However with the vaccine presenting a light at the end of the tunnel, we have an opportunity to emerge in a better place than 12 months ago. If we get it right, we can take advantage of the collaborative and social spaces in our studio, as well as the peace and convenience of working from home (or indeed a villa in Spain). In doing so we&#8217;ll improve both our working practices and our home life – small victories in the grand scheme of things, but worth grabbing while we can.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hereâ€™s a compilation of favourite songs from those I bought in the last year (not all were released this year). I certainly purchased a lot, and I&#8217;m pretty pleased with how the playlist panned out. Turns out my absolute favourites were electronic pop from relatively recent years – I&#8217;m particularly enjoying New Order&#8217;s <em>Music Complete</em> from 2015, and I absolutely love RÃ³isÃ­n Murphy&#8217;s <em>Overpowered</em> from 2007 (I bought four of her 12&#8221; singles too). All of which sound fantastic on vinyl. Speaking of which, the quintuple vinyl of Kruder &amp; Dorfmeisterâ€™s classic <em>K&amp;D Sessions</em> compilation is a spectacular listen.</p>

<p>Other favourites include Ian Brown&#8217;s and Steve Mason&#8217;s most recent albums, both from 2019. New this year was a beautiful Erland Cooper offering celebrating more of the Orkney Islands, yet more Four Tet doing electronica in his inimitable way, loud frustration from Idles and a sweary compilation of working class minimalism from Sleaford Mods.</p>

</div><!-- /.prose --><figure><img src="http://clagnut.com/images/2020vinyl.jpg" alt="Photo" /><figcaption>Forty-odd vinyl records spread out on my floor</figcaption></figure><div class='prose'>

<p>Because I keep these playlists roughly to the length of a <abbr class='c2sc'>CD</abbr>, there are some notable omissions from this list. Tim Burgessâ€™s 2012 collaboration with Lambchopâ€™s Kurt Wagner is worthy of note especially as it contains a (lovely) song entitled <em>A Case for Vinyl</em>. Nick Caveâ€™s <em>Idiot Prayer – alone at Alexandria Palace</em> is definitely an album to sum up the year weâ€™ve just had. Some golden oldies include opportunistic re-releases of <abbr class='c2sc'>OMD</abbr>â€™s first album and Ozric Tentaclesâ€™ <em>Strangitude</em> (the one with <em>Sploosh!</em>), both worth having mind you.
As is Billy Cobhamâ€™s <em>Spectrum</em>, a 1970s jazz-fusion drumfest heavily sampled by Massive Attack. Finally a worthy last minute entry goes to local boy Fatboy Slimâ€™s <em>Back to Mine</em> compilation which is chock full of funky classics, including the original source material for <em>Praise You</em>.</p>
