<p class="intro">The previous website for Channel&nbsp;4 News was centred around breaking news. This was at odds with the on-air brand which is focussd on in-depth, quality reporting. Consequently the website was failing to support the Channel&nbsp;4 News brand and readership was suffering.</p>

<h2>Our Solution</h2>

<h5>Research.</h5>
<p>Clearleft co-located at Channel&nbsp;4 offices in London to aid decision making and maximise project visibility. We also spent a significant amount of time with the news team at ITN, understanding their workflow and the nature of the newsroom.</p>

<h5>Ideation.</h5>
<p>After a series of workshops involving key stakeholders from Channel&nbsp;4 and ITN, our team moved into a period of rapid idea generation, sketching possible directions the service could take. These were displayed on a &#8216;sketch board&#8217; within Channel&nbsp;4&#8217;s offices, enabling passing feedback and engagement with our progress.</p>
<p>During ideation, we designed an innovative approach to footer-based navigation (dubbed &#8216;gravigation&#8217;) which focused the user on the content over browsing. Being a novel approach, we ran usability tests on the device &ndash; the results were good so the gravigation stayed.</p>

<h5>Visual Design.</h5>
<p>Working closely with Channel&nbsp;4&#8217;s creative team, we draw on the programmes unique bold on-air brand, tying the website into Channel&nbsp;4&#8217;s overall news proposition. We designed a modular design system which provided a framework for all pages, and enabled future pages to put togther by the editorial team.</p>
