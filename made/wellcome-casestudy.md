# Wellcome Library

The Wellcome Library provides insight and information to anyone seeking to understand medicine and its role in society, past and present. As part of a five-year transformation strategy, Wellcome approached Clearleft to provide them with a new website which incorporates new content from digitised records along with making their existing content easier to access.

`Rich, do you think a bit about UX research/design should go here?`

The design of the Wellcome library was approached in a modular way, which has several benefits for large content heavy websites. Modular designs are made up of a clear, consistent design language that users can quickly understand and recognise throughout the site. In addition to this, a modular site is more flexible when a site needs to adapt or grow in the future.

Rather than handing over fully compiled pages or lengthy documentation, Clearleft provided a pattern portfolio to back end development team, [Digirati](http://www.digirati.co.uk). The pattern portfolio comprises of a collection of code fragments presented in a single page, along with a series of examples which pull together these fragments into pages.

This pattern portfolio reinforces the modular design system established during the visual design phase. These code fragments, called patterns, can be placed in any combination to create any page of the website. This in turn creates a more flexible website where individual parts can be reorganised and reused without breaking.

By taking this approach, everyone involved is afforded greater flexibility . For Clearleft, the modular nature of the pattern portfolio enables us to make changes to specific components without affecting the rest of the site. For the developers, it means they can take the individual modules and reproduce them within a CMS, ready for use by editorial teams. For those involved in the editorial process, it means they can reliably use any combination of components.

We've found that this design approach benefits the vast majority of projects we embark upon. For the Wellcome Library project, it's been particularly appreciated and has confirmed the benefits of such a system to us. 

"I like the Pattern Portfolio so much that Iâ€™d want to insist that anyone delivering front-end assets to me does so with this or something very similar."
