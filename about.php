<h2>Richard Rutter</h2>

<p><span class="opener">I am co-founder of <a href="http://clearleft.com/is/richard-rutter" rel="me">Clearleft</a> and <a href="http://fontdeck.com">Fontdeck</a></span>. I started designing websites way back in 1994. Since founding Clearleft with <a href="http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd">Andy Budd</a> and <a href="http://clearleft.com/is/jeremy-keith">Jeremy Keith</a>, I’ve retained my role as a user experience designer, working with clients and their customers to translate their ideas into new and improved websites and applications.</p>

<figure class='inline'><img src="/images/Richard-Rutter-600x900.jpg" alt="Photo of Richard Rutter by Jack Barnes" /><figcaption>Photo by Jack Barnes</figcaption></figure>

<p>I began my career designing the <abbr>UX</abbr> of web sites for Barclaycard, as well as numerous dot com start ups. I moved on to become the user experience lead at Multimap, Europe’s most popular mapping site, which was acquired by Microsoft.</p>
<p>At Clearleft my work includes redesigning the Riverford Organics web site, creating a new e-commerce presence for Pearson Education, improving student help for the Open University, designing a radical new location-based search for Gumtree and streamlining Amnesty International’s operations. I am currently redesigning a video-on-demand service for a major broadcaster.</p>
<p>I was named as one of <cite>Wired <abbr>UK</abbr></cite>’s top 100 digital power brokers.</p>
<h3>Web typography evangelism</h3>
<p>I have a deep love and fascination for typography. I created Clearleft’s Fontdeck web service, in partnership with OmniTI and Jon Tan. As a self-appointed web typography evangelist, I am chief organiser of Clearleft’s Ampersand web typography conference. I also put together <a href="http://webtypography.net/">webtypography.net</a> which translates Bringhurst’s typographic guidelines into <abbr>CSS</abbr>. I have a web typography book in the works with Five Simple Steps.</p>
<p>I am a member of the <abbr title="Interaction Design Association">IxDA</abbr>, London <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr> group and <abbr title="Association Typographique International">ATypI</abbr>. I have spoken at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/clagnut/past/speaking/">numerous conferences</a> on prototyping and typography, including An Event Apart, <abbr>UIE</abbr>’s Web App Summit and <abbr>UX</abbr> London.</p>
<h3>Away from the office</h3>
<p>I am an avid Chelsea <abbr>FC</abbr> fan, regularly shouting from the stands at Stamford Bridge. I used to describe myself as a mountain biker, but family commitments mean that’s mostly limited to cycling into work, although I’m trying to get out on the bike(s) a bit more.</p>
<p>For some reason I still buy <abbr>CD</abbr>s and vinyl.</p>

<h3>Stalk Me</h3>

<p>Bits of me are scattered around the web. Here’s some of them.</p>
