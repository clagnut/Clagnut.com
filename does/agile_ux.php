<p class="leader">Agile UX means designing user experiences in an Agile manner or within a development team's Agile framework.</p>
<p>Agile replaces the so-called waterfall project process with a method that encourages collaboration between departments and rapid, iterative design and development. Rather than specifying a system's behaviour in full before it is built, Agile focuses on designing and developing certain user journeys at a time. The system is therefore completed iteratively, building new sections and revising previous work. Working in this manner is popular with developers but challenging for designers, however we have had a lot of success designing UX within Agile environments.</p>
