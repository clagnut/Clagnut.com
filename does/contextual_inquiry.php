<p class="leader">Contextual Inquiry is a form of fly-on-the-wall user research where users are observed in their own environment.</p>
<p>Observing people interacting with products or services whilst going about their daily lives, usually followed up by interviews, provides detailed insight on tasks, pain points and user preferences. It avoids the problems of self-reporting in interviews where people naturally omit salient points or make inaacurate claims about their goals because of the challenges of remmebering details and the unusual task of self-analysis.</p>
