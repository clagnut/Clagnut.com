## When did you start doing web stuff?
I began building my first website on 14th January 1999. That I remember this date so vividly might explain why I'm still designing websites 13 years later.

## Who did you work for before Clearleft?
Before Clearleft, I worked at a small start-up in California called [Ning][1]--a company founded by [Marc Andreessen][2] no less. As lead designer, I was responsible for developing the companies distinctive branding and designed their initial set of social products.

## What do you do at Clearleft?
I can go by any number of titles (Visual Designer, Interaction Designer or even plain old Web Designer) but sometimes it's best to keep things simple so let's just say Designer.

I work with clients to understand their business goals, working to ensure that any branding and messaging is reflected accurately on their website. I love collaborating with user experience designers to create effective and usable interfaces, and working alongside front-end developers to establish visual language systems that can be expressed in markup and CSS.

I also work on Fontdeck, where I'm responsible for the overall design direction of the service.

## What unique skills do you have within Clearleft?
I'm fascinated by the concept of responsive web design, especially from the perspective of how this informs workflow; moving from linear (and sometimes segregated) processes to those that are more agile and collaborative.

I'm also interested in design systems such as the BBC's [Global Experience Language (GEL)][3]. By developing common design and interaction patterns, we can combine the systems of the web and visual design to great effect.

## Which clients have you worked for at Clearleft?
Dennis Publishing - UX and visual design, interactive prototyping
DACS - Visual design, front-end development
Nuts.com - Visual design, interaction design, usability testing

## What other things do you help out with in the web community

## What are you currently (or recently) working on?
A website for DACS (the Design and Artists Copyright Society) and a quick project for NRDC.

## What do you do outside of work?
I'm becoming increasingly attracted to running, and this year I even managed to run an entire marathon! I also like to travel, especially [by train][9], and I will be volunteering at this year's Olympic and Paralympic games.
