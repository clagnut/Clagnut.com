\f0\fs32 \cf0 Hey Rich, hope you enjoyed your holiday.\
\
Here's my info for the Bio.  Won't be as fantastic as the other Clearlefties, so if you need me to flesh it out a bit more,  let me know.\
\
-----------------\
\
## When did you start doing web stuff?\
Besides the basic messing around in Mosaic and early painful memories of IE5, my first foray into websites was back in 2002.  After being hugely inspired by a colleague in Montreal in 2003, I realised web design was where I wanted to be.\
\
\
## Who did you work for before Clearleft?\
Myself.  For 3.5 years I've run my own small studio called CarbonGraffiti, where I offered design, development or marketing services for a number of clients including the British Medical Journal, VirginGalactic, VirginHolidays, Interscope records, Macmillan, NBCUniversal and EnglishUK.\
\
Prior to that, I led a second life as a digital marketing manager, where I managed all facets of the acquisition process through digital-only channels. Notably, the major difference was that I put design at the forefront of the marketing process. This experience afforded me some unique views on design and how it can and should be used in a marketing context.\
\
\
## What do you do at Clearleft?\
My title is visual designer, which on the outside is to make things look pretty. In reality it's the aesthetic output of close collaboration, communication and understanding of client needs, UX and Dev\'85 of course with a sprinkling of inspiration and perspiration along the way.\
\
\
## What unique skills do you have within Clearleft?\
I'm a hybrid by nature\'85 although I focus on visual design, I have a clear understanding of responsive design, and can't recall the last time I designed and built a fixed-width site.  This hybridisation helps me understand the intricacies and nuances of deigning for the multi-device web.\
\
Additionally, as my background involves a lot of marketing, I tend to gravitate towards the needs and marketing-centric goals of the client organisation. I always try to find the way in which design and marketing intersect, which in my view proves that good design leads to good marketing, and good marketing should be based on good design (sadly it often isn't).\
\
\
## Which clients have you worked for at Clearleft?\
NBC Universal - Visual design\
Nuts - Visual design\
The Holiday Place - Visual design\
\
\
## What relevant post-graduate qualifications do you have?\
BA (Hons) Human Environment (Rich: haha, sure as hell not relevant to design)\
\
\
## What industry organisations are you a member of eg. UPA, IxDA, ISTD, IChemE, Ofcom, CIA, BNM\
Nil\
\
\
## What notable conferences or meet-ups have you spoken at?\
None in the web industry proper, but have given talks on responsive design, and the intersection between digital marketing and design for EnglishUK (accreditation body for International Education/English language training industry)\
\
\
## Where have you been published?\
Nil\
\
\
## What other things do you help out with in the web community\
I have volunteered with the Brighton Digital Festival since its inception. I love the vibe and culture of Brighton and feel its digital presence is only going to get stronger and want to help the city realise that aspiration.\
\
I also run an email design gallery that showcases inspiring and well-designed email marketing campaigns.\
\
\
## What are you currently (or recently) working on?\
A full-scale redesign of a popular holiday booking website.\
\
\
## What do you do outside of work?\
I'm a husband, and a full-time dad of 2 wonderful daughters, so that pretty much sums up my time outside of work.  Otherwise I'm either playing football or trying to watch it, or, like Rich, trying to resurrect my Mountain Biking days or yore.\
