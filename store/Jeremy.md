## When did you start doing web stuff?
I think it was around 1997 or thereabouts. I made a website for the band I was playing with at the time. It didn't turn out too badly.

## Who did you work for before Clearleft?
I was a freelancer before we started Clearleft. I was nervous about the prospect of coming into the same place to work every day (as a freelancer, I was used to a more itinerant lifestyle) but it all worked out in the end.

## What do you do at Clearleft?
What an excellent question!

I like to think of myself as the Research and Development wing of Clearleft: investigating new technologies, trying out new techniques, and keeping abreast of the ever-changing world of web development.

In other words, I spend most of my time goofing off on the internet. But it mostly ends up being useful at some later point.

When I *do* end up doing some actual work, it's mostly front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wish I had the chance to do other kinds of work--the stuff that gets lumped under the categories of "UX" or "design" (a fairly arbitrary distinction, in my opinion)--but sadly the job roles at Clearleft have somewhat ossified and solidified over time.

## What unique skills do you have within Clearleft?
My anal-retentive pedantry results in good markup.

I also have a very short attention span so that means
