The visual design of this website is unashamedly based on the front cover of a fabulous book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/389955468X?tag=jalfrezi-21"><cite>Designing News</cite></a> by <a href="http://www.FrancescoFranchi.com">Francesco Franchi</a>, as published in hard back September 2013.

The type is set in Premi√©ra designed by <a href="http://gabrieltype.com/">Thomas Gabriel</a>, with headlines set in Michael Hochleitner's <a href="https://www.typejockeys.com/font/ingeborg">Ingeborg</a>.

The site is built on a homemade <abbr class="smcp">CMS</abbr>. It was hand-coded in <a href="https://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a>, marked up using semantic <abbr class="smcp">HTML</abbr> and <abbr class="smcp">CSS</abbr>.

I've used responsive design techniques to hopefully ensure the site is nicely readable on lots of devices. I've put together a kind of <a href="/styles">style guide</a>, mostly as a check that all likely mark-up is styled appropriately. While the site has not been widely tested, it should be fine on all modern browsers. Please <a href="/about#contact">let me know</a> if you come across any problems. </p>
                
<p>I use and recommend <a href="http://my.vidahost.com/aff.php?aff=1321">Vidahost</a> for web hosting. They've proved very helpful thus far.</p>
